gulp-automation
===============

Front-end web development automation with node, gulp and compass.

Installation
--------------

You need to have a node-enabled environment and be able to access the node packet management commands.

- Run the install.bat windows batch file
- With npm added to your PATH environmental variables, run the following commands:

```
npm install gulp
npm install gulp-uglifyjs
npm install gulp-concat-sourcemap
npm install gulp-autoprefixer
npm install gulp-minify-css
npm install gulp-compass
npm install gulp-notify
npm install gulp-rename
npm install gulp-clean
```

If you would like to receive notifications from gulp-notify, you must install snarl.

TODO
------

* ~~Move dependencies to package.json~~
* Modularize each task in external file
* Add image-min support
